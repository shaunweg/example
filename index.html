      <p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>

      <p>From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and good luck, my friends. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Do an almighty painting with us. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>

      <p>Let your heart be your guide. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>

        <h2>About Bob Ross Ipsum</h2>
        <p>In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without relying on meaningful content. Replacing the actual content with placeholder text allows designers to design the form of the content before the content itself has been produced.</p>
        <p>Some designers decided they wanted something a little more interesting than the basic Lorem Ipsum. As such, many alternate versions and generators hae been created. Bob Ross Ipsum is one such example, based on the phrases and sayings of the late American painter, Bob Ross.
